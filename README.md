# FlaskProject
The project is to develop a web-based application for visitor log. This project will use Flask for web development and also use a database (sqlite3) to store users’ data.

This visitor login website is for visitors to register at the front desk.  They will use the website to provide their name, email address, phone number and the person they are visiting (host name). If any of the information is incorrect, the website will highlight the error and provide appropriate error message. If all entries are valid, visitors’ information will be stored in the sqlite3 database.

The visitor website has ability to view the list of all visitors’ information and to download visitors’ information as an excel file or a csv file.
